IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THESE TERMS NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, THEN DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES NOW, OR FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF ANY CHANGES IN THESE TERMS, WILL INDICATE ACCEPTANCE AND AGREEMENT BY YOU OF SUCH CHANGES.

It is your responsibility to ensure your equipment (computer, laptop, netbook, tablet or other mobile device) meets all the necessary technical specifications to enable you to access and use the Services, if any. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is at your sole risk and responsibility.

            Reservation of Rights

            All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Degree Me and its licensors and other third parties.

            Products

            In providing the Services, we may make physical or digital products available to you for purchase. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of products or to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products that we offer. All descriptions of products or product pricing are subject to change at any time without notice, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time. Any offer for any product or made through the Services is void where prohibited. We do not warrant that the quality of any products purchased or obtained by you will meet your expectations, or that any errors will be corrected.
            In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the email and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made. 

            You agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms or to any sale of goods carried out as a result of your use of the Services. 

            All physical products purchased from the Services are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon delivery to the carrier. 

            Accounts

            Certain features of the Services may require you to create an account and become a registered user. It is important that you provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information for your account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up to date. If you do not, we may suspend or terminate your account. We reserve the right to initiate forfeiture of any username for any reason or to disable any log-on ID, at any time, if in our opinion you fail to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms or if any details provided are proved or suspected to be false. 

            You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account, whether or not you are aware of them. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols) with your account. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. If your account is hacked or any third parties use your account, you should immediately notify us and follow our instructions. We may restrict usage, terminate, and/or delete any account at any time in our sole discretion.

            You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases made using our Services. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed.

            Use of the Services is void where prohibited. By registering an account and using the Services, you represent and warrant that: (i) all registration data that you submit is truthful and accurate; (ii) you are the age of consent in your country/region or older, or have your parent or guardian’s consent; and (iii) your use of the Services will not violate any applicable law or regulation, these Terms, or any other rules, policies, or notices published by us; and (iv) you are a “natural person” (corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships and other legal or business entities are not eligible and must apply for an “Enterprise License” with us).

            Subscriptions

            Certain areas of the Services require payment before you can access them (“Subscriptions”). Subscriptions can be purchased by paying a periodic subscription fee. We will disclose to you the particular terms for any Subscription prior to collecting initial payment for any Subscription. When you register for a Subscription, you get access to the premium areas of our Service. SUBSCRIPTIONS CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND WE WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID. Your payment will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period unless you cancel your Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period. We may change the price for the Subscriptions, from time to time, by posting the new price on its Service. Price changes for Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Service prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully. 

            From time to time, we may offer trials of Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). We will require you to provide your payment information to start the Trial. UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR TRIAL BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL, WE WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOU FOR A SUBSCRIPTION ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE TRIAL, ON A REOCCURRING MONTHLY BASIS. Your Subscription will be subject to the terms set forth in this Section. 

            We do our best to describe every product or service offered on our Service as accurately as possible. However, we do not warrant that product specifications, pricing, or other content on the Service is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion. If we charged your account prior to our cancellation, we would issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge. If a product or service you purchased from our is not as described, your sole remedy is to cancel the purchase and receive a credit for the purchase price. 

            For any purchases made through third party platform providers, such as Apple or Google, please contact their customer support. Their terms, conditions and policies, and not ours, apply and we do not handle returns or refund requests for purchases through those third party platform providers. 

            We will endeavor to notify you of any price increases at least thirty (30) days prior to such price increase taking effect.

            Pricing 

            All prices and availability of products are subject to change without notice. We make every effort to provide you the most accurate information on pricing and availability. Further, some products may be incorrectly priced. In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price, we have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for the product listed at the incorrect price.

            DISPUTE RESOLUTION

            PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

            Agreement to Arbitrate 

            You and Degree Me agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the use of the Services (“Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court (a “Small Claims Action”) and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in New York County and Degree Me and you waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts and consent to their jurisdiction. You agree you may bring arbitration claims only on your own behalf and not on behalf of any other person or entity.
            Unless you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice (as defined below in the subsection titled “Your Choices”), you acknowledge and agree that you and Degree Me are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Degree Me otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. 

            This clause does not limit either party’s ability to file an action in a court with jurisdiction to seek injunctive or other equitable relief for disputes relating to intellectual property, proprietary data, or to enforce this dispute resolution clause, including your agreement not to assert claims related to the suspension or termination of another person’s account. In any such action, the court rather than an arbitrator must decide whether such a claim is arbitrable and must decide whether the party is entitled to the requested injunctive or other equitable relief.

            Arbitration Rules

            The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS.  Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator.  If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267.  

            Arbitration Process

            A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules (JAMS provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www. Jamsadr.com). The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from JAMS’ roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, then JAMS will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules.

            Arbitration Location and Procedure

            Unless you and Degree Me otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the state where you reside, with the option for you to participate telephonically to the extent the JAMS Rules allow. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Degree Me submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. Subject to the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

            Arbitrator’s Decision

            The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions which the arbitrator based its award on. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the arbitration award. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” Section of these Terms as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Degree Me will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration, unless such arbitration is found by the arbitrator to be frivolous under the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11(b) and in that case, Degree Me shall be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees in addition to any damages awarded to it.

            Fees

            If the arbitrator finds that your payment of the administrative and arbitrator fees (excluding any attorney’s fees) under this subsection is a burden on you, we agree to pay those fees for you (but not any attorney’s fees). 

            Changes

            By rejecting any changes to these Terms, you agree that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Degree Me in accordance with the provisions of this Section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

            Representative PAGA Waiver.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms or the Agreement to Arbitrate, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Company expressly intend and agree not to assert a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Company agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Agreement to Arbitrate or the requirement that any remaining disputes be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Agreement to Arbitrate; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any disputes to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration.

            Exceptions to Arbitration.

            This Agreement to Arbitrate shall not require arbitration of the following types of disputes: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; or (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not preempted by the FAA.

            Your Choices

            If you do not want to settle Disputes by arbitration as described above, you will notify us by sending us written notice (including by email to chithe@uncc.edu telling us that you do not want to use arbitration, within thirty (30) days of the date on which you agreed to these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you do not provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except for a Small Claims Action and an IP Protection Action as stated above.
